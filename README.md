# Ancient Arena

## Concept

You are a wizard competing in an arena for a great reward that will set you up for life. You have to use your magic to survive beasts, monsters, and other wizards. When you're defeated you return to round one but the money you earn in the arena can be spent on permanent upgrades. Each round survived gains you XP to level, you can improve your armor or magic stat each time you level up.
